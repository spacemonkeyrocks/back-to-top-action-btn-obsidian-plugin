# Product Context: Why This Plugin Exists

## 1. Problem Solved

Obsidian is a powerful tool for knowledge management, often leading to very long, aggregated notes. Navigating these documents can be cumbersome. When a user scrolls deep into a note to review or add information, returning to the top requires a tedious and lengthy manual scroll. This small but frequent friction point disrupts workflow and can be frustrating, especially on mobile devices with touch-based scrolling.

## 2. Target User

The ideal user for this plugin is any Obsidian user who regularly works with long-form content and uses tables of contents. This includes:

* **Researchers and Academics**: Who compile extensive literature notes.
* **Writers and Bloggers**: Who draft long articles or book chapters.
* **Students**: Who create comprehensive study guides or lecture notes.
* **Project Managers**: Who maintain detailed project logs or meeting minutes in a single document.

Essentially, anyone who has ever felt the slight annoyance of having to "scroll, and scroll, and scroll" to get back to the top of a note will find immediate value in this plugin.

## 3. Value Proposition

The **Back to Top Action Button** offers a simple, elegant solution to a common navigation problem. Its core value is improving the **quality of life** within Obsidian.

* **Saves Time & Effort**: Replaces dozens of mouse-wheel or finger swipes with a single click.
* **Improves Workflow**: Reduces navigational friction, allowing users to stay focused on their content.
* **Feels Native**: Through its intelligent mobile adaptation and customization options, the button feels like a built-in feature of Obsidian, not an afterthought. This seamless integration is a key differentiator.
