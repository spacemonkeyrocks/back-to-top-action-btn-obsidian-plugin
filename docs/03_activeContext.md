# Active Context: Current Project Status

## 1. Current Focus

The plugin is **stable and feature-complete**. The primary focus has shifted from active development to **maintenance**. This involves:

* Ensuring compatibility with new releases of Obsidian.
* Monitoring user feedback for potential bugs or minor improvement suggestions.
* Keeping the development dependencies and build process up-to-date.

## 2. Recent Changes

The codebase is mature. The most significant recent developments, which have now been completed and stabilized, were:

* **Refined Mobile Integration**: The logic in `mobile-utils.js` was improved to more reliably detect and adapt to the native mobile UI elements across different themes and device sizes.
* **Enhanced Logging System**: A more robust, multi-level logging system was implemented in `logger.js` to aid in faster debugging and user support. A key fix was implemented in `main.js` to ensure settings were loaded *before* the first log message was written, preventing startup errors.
* **Automated Release Pipeline**: The `semantic-release` configuration (`.releaserc.json`) and Docker setup (`Dockerfile`) were finalized to automate the entire release process, from versioning to publishing on GitHub.

## 3. Ongoing Issues / Known Bugs

There are **no known critical bugs** at this time. The plugin is considered fully functional as per its design goals.
